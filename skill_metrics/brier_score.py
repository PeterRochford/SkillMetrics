    '''
    Calculate Brier score (BS) between two variables

    Calculates the Brier score (BS), a measure of the mean-square error of
    probability forecasts for a dichotomous (two-category) event, such as
    the occurrence/non-occurrence of precipitation. The score is calculated
    using the formula:

    BS = sum_(n=1)^N (f_n - o_n)^2/N

    where f is the forecast probabilities, o is the observed probabilities
    (0 or 1), and N is the total number of values in f & o. Note that f & o
    must have the same number of values, and those values must be in the
    range [0,1].

    Input:
    FORECAST : forecast probabilities
    OBSERVED : observed probabilities

    Output:
    BS : Brier score
